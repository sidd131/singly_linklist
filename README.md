# singly_linklist
 A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer.

We implement Linked List  using user defined data type, with the help of structure or struct. Since Singly linked list has only 1 pointer type value, which means it can store the address of only one node, which will be  the next to it. As a result, we can only move in one direction in a Singly Linked List i.e; from head to tail, which makes traversing a linked list more difficult. Implementing  linked list  rather than using array is better, since the insertion and deletion operations in  Linked List are less complicated and less time consuming in comparison with arrays.
Applications of Singly Linked List are as following:
It is used to implement stacks and queues which are like fundamental needs throughout computer science.
To prevent the collision between the data in the hash map, we use a singly linked list.
If we ever noticed the functioning of a casual notepad, it also uses a singly linked list to perform undo or redo or deleting functions.
We can think of its use in a photo viewer for having look at photos continuously in a slide show.
In the system of train, the idea is like a singly linked list, as if you want to add a Boggie, either you have to take a new boggie to add at last or you must spot a place in between boggies and add it.
